export const about = {
  title: "About Me",
  content: `I'm a software engineer who doesn't just write code—I architect solutions that turn complex problems into elegant, scalable realities. Ever since flashing my first custom Android ROM back in 2016, I've been obsessed with understanding how things work under the hood and finding ways to make them work better.

My journey isn't about following trends; it's about pushing boundaries. I thrive in high-pressure environments where every decision matters, and I've proven I can deliver when it counts—from rescuing mission-critical systems to engineering AI-powered solutions that actually solve real problems.

Beyond the professional realm, I'm constantly tinkering and experimenting. I automate my entire life with n8n workflows, run Ollama locally for AI experimentation, and treat every challenge as an opportunity to build something smarter, faster, and more resilient.

I'm not looking for just any role—I'm seeking opportunities where I can apply my full-stack expertise, AI/ML innovation, and relentless problem-solving drive to build systems that matter.`,
