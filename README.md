### Hi there, I'm Himanshu 👋  
**Full-stack Engineer | DevOps & Cloud Enthusiast | Building resilient end-to-end systems**

I'm a software engineer and lifelong tinkerer, driven by curiosity and a love for solving complex problems. Coding isn't just a job—it's my passion. I thrive on building elegant solutions, whether that's architecting a full-stack application, automating workflows, or diving deep into system security.  

My tech journey started in 2016, flashing custom ROMs on Android devices—sparking my interest in system optimization and security. Recently, I built a no-code automation pipeline with **n8n** to manage my entire job application process—from sorting emails to sending Slack reminders.  

I love to learn, I love to build, and I'm always chasing the next challenging problem.

### 🌱 Recent Experience Highlights

As the sole engineer at a startup, I built, managed, and secured their entire digital ecosystem in a high-pressure environment:  

- **Full-stack enterprise portal:** Architected with **Next.js & MongoDB**, managing 50+ APIs and database models.  
- **Disaster recovery & security:** Restored 100% of live production services on **AWS EC2**, implementing improved security protocols.  
- **CI/CD automation:** Built a pipeline from scratch using **Docker & GitHub Actions** for seamless deployments.  
- **Mobile app development:** Developed a three-sided marketplace app using **Flutter**.  

This experience reinforced my passion for resilient, end-to-end systems and taught me more in 4 months than most learn in years.
